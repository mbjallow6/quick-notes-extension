# Handover Note for Quick Notes Chrome Extension Development

**Date:** 2025-07-15 21:35:39 (Current UTC Time)

**Project:** Quick Notes Scratchpad Chrome Extension
**Current Directory:** `/home/luka/Documents/dev/quick-notes-extension/`
**Current Git Branch:** `feature/color-coding-verified` (This branch contains all completed work described below and is ready for merge into `main` by the user.)

---

### I. Summary of Work Completed:

The following feature from **Epic 1: Rich & Interactive Content** has been fully implemented and verified by the user:

*   **"Add Color-Coding for Notes & Checklists"**
    *   **Phase 1: Per-Note/Checklist Highlight Colors**
        *   Implemented a discrete UI element (color picker button) on each note and checklist header.
        *   Defined a set of pre-approved, accessible highlight colors as CSS variables in `src/popup.css`.
        *   Implemented JavaScript logic in `src/popup.js` to store the selected color ID for each content item in `chrome.storage.local`.
        *   Modified rendering functions to dynamically apply the chosen color (background and text color) based on the stored `colorId`.
    *   **Phase 2: Basic Theming (Light/Dark Mode Toggle)**
        *   Added a theme toggle button (‚òÄÔ∏è / üåô) to the header in `src/popup.html`.
        *   Defined CSS variables for both light and dark themes in `src/popup.css` (using a `.dark-mode` class).
        *   Implemented JavaScript logic in `src/popup.js` to toggle the `dark-mode` class on the `<body>` and persist this preference in `chrome.storage.local`.
        *   Ensured all existing UI components adapt correctly to the active theme.

*   **`PROJECT_PLAN.md` has been updated** to reflect the completion of both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the color-coding feature.

### II. Current Application State:

*   The application is in a working state. All features implemented (including drag-and-drop, collapse, color-coding, and theme toggle) have been functionally verified by the user.
*   The code for the completed features resides on the `feature/color-coding-verified` branch.

### III. Next Task for Incoming Agent:

The next major task in the roadmap, as per `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, is to:

*   **Implement Markdown & Code Syntax Highlighting** (under **Epic 1: Rich & Interactive Content**).

### IV. Instructions for Incoming Agent:

1.  **Synchronize your local repository**: Pull the latest changes from `main` and then merge `feature/color-coding-verified` into your local `main` (or await the user's merge on GitHub).
2.  **Familiarize yourself with the code**: Review `src/popup.js` and `src/popup.css` to understand the current structure and how the color-coding and theming were implemented.
3.  **Begin planning for "Markdown & Code Syntax Highlighting"**: 
    *   Consider the architectural impact.
    *   Research lightweight and secure JavaScript libraries for syntax highlighting (e.g., `highlight.js`, `Prism.js`). Remember the user's emphasis on lightweight, safety, security, and elegance; external libraries should be carefully chosen and ideally lazy-loaded if needed.
    *   Propose a breakdown of subtasks and a high-level approach for this feature to the user before starting implementation.
4.  **Maintain clean coding practices and small, incremental changes** to avoid issues like the ones encountered during the theme implementation.
